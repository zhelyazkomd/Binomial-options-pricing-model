    "An options contract is an agreement between two parties to facilitate a potential transaction on an underlying security at a preset price, referred to as the strike price, prior to or on the expiration date. Options are financial instruments that are based on the value of underlying securities such as stocks. An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell—depending on the type of contract they hold—the chosen underlying asset at a price set out in the contract either within a certain timeframe or at the expiration date.\n",
