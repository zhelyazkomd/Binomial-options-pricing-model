    "\n",
    "**Valuation of options:** Options are financial derivatives whose value depends on the price movements of an underlying asset. Option pricing models enable market participants to determine the fair value of options, allowing them to make informed investment decisions. These models take into account factors such as the current price of the underlying asset, the strike price, time to expiration, volatility, and interest rates to calculate the option's value.\n",

    "##### What Is Binomial Option Pricing Model?\n",
    "The binomial option pricing model is employed to calculate the value of an option using an iterative binomial framework. It is based on the presumption that the underlying asset’s value follows a path of evolution. Hence it either increases or decreases by a fixed percentage during each period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial pricing model was first proposed by mathematicians Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein in 1979. The model provides a simple way to portray stock price movements and the interest rate term structure. The binomial model displays the underlying stock price movements using a discrete-time binomial lattice (tree) framework. One can identify it just by the probability of an upward rise and the size of the moves in the upward and downward phases of the options.\n",
    "\n",
    "An option is a significant financial derivative that provides the holder with the right to trade a defined quantity of the underlying asset at an agreed amount on the maturity date for a ***European option*** or at any time on or before the maturity date for an ***American option***.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=text-align:center><b>Binomial Tree Scheme</b></p>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/BOPM_scheme.jpg\" width=\"450\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial lattice option pricing model is a simple approach to calculating possible option prices. The model works on the key assumption that only two possible results exist for a particular stock. The two possible outcomes are a high and a low price. So the possibilities are also an assumption that the prices could go up or down. Therefore, investors need to assume the occurrence of the two stock prices at the end of the provided period. As always, one cannot predict this price with certainty, and it carries risks like all investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also works with the assumption of no arbitrage. i.e., there is no buying while selling at a higher price. No-arbitrage guarantees that the asset's value doesn't change. According to the no-arbitrage assumption, all risk-free investments generate a risk-free rate of return, and no investment possibilities demand zero money and generate positive returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practices ensure that the prices of financial assets, such as options, are fixed to a minimal tolerance from their theoretical values. One-period time model or one-period binomial option pricing model and multi-period binomial option pricing model or two-step binomial option pricing model are the types of binomial models used to determine option prices, and assumptions apply to them too."

    "The binomial model approach is a mathematical model used to value options and other financial derivatives. It is based on several basic principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discrete Time:** The binomial model assumes that time is divided into a series of discrete intervals, typically equal in length. This allows for a step-by-step analysis of the underlying asset's price movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Possible Outcomes:** At each time step, the underlying asset's price can only move in one of two directions: up or down. These movements are usually assumed to be proportional, meaning that the up movement is a multiple of the down movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk-Neutral Probability:** The model assumes a risk-neutral probability, which is the probability of an up or down movement that would make the expected return on the underlying asset equal to the risk-free rate. This risk-neutral probability is used to calculate the option's value at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option Valuation:** The binomial model values options by constructing a binomial tree that represents all possible price paths of the underlying asset over time. Starting from the final time step (expiration date), the option value is calculated at each node of the tree by discounting the expected future payoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Replication Strategy:** The binomial model assumes that it is possible to replicate the option's payoffs by trading in the underlying asset and the risk-free asset (such as a bond). By adjusting the proportions of these two assets, a portfolio can be constructed to replicate the option's cash flows. The value of the option is then determined by the initial cost of this replicating portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using these principles, the binomial model provides a framework for valuing options and understanding how their prices change over time. It is a relatively simple model that can handle various types of options, including European and American-style options, as well as options on stocks, currencies, and other assets."

    "The binomial model assumes that the underlying asset price can move up or down over discrete time intervals based on a few key assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Division: The model divides time into a series of discrete intervals. Each interval represents a fixed period, such as a day, a month, or a year. These intervals allow for a step-by-step analysis of the underlying asset's price movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proportional Movements: At each time step, the underlying asset's price is assumed to move in one of two directions: up or down. The model assumes that these price movements are proportional to each other. Typically, the up movement is denoted by a factor (often denoted as \"u\") and the down movement by another factor (often denoted as \"d\"). The magnitude of these factors determines the size of the price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeated Application: The model applies the proportional movements repeatedly over each time interval. Starting from the initial price of the underlying asset, the price can move up by multiplying it by the factor \"u\" or move down by multiplying it by the factor \"d\" at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the initial price of the underlying asset is denoted as S0, after one time step, the possible prices would be $S_0u$ (up movement) or $S_0d$ (down movement). After the second time step, the prices would be $S_0u^2$ (two consecutive up movements), S0ud (up movement followed by a down movement), or $S_0d^2$ (two consecutive down movements). This process continues for the desired number of time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "By assuming these discrete up and down movements, the binomial model simplifies the price movement of the underlying asset into a binary tree structure, where each node represents a possible price at a specific time step. This allows for a systematic evaluation of the option's value at each node of the tree, leading to the overall valuation of the option.\n"

    "First of all we need to understand what is no-arbitrage principle and why do we need to use it to price derivatives.The concept of \"no arbitrage\" is a fundamental principle in financial markets. It states that it should not be possible to make risk-free profits without any investment or net cash flow. In the context of option pricing, the assumption of no arbitrage means that the model assumes the absence of opportunities to generate riskless profits by trading the underlying asset and the option. The absence of arbitrage ensures that the model's pricing is fair and consistent with market conditions. Risk-neutral probabilities are a key concept in option pricing models, including the binomial model.\n",

By assuming risk-neutral probabilities, the model simplifies the valuation process and ensures that the option prices are consistent with the market prices.\n",

This assumption simplifies the calculations and allows for frictionless trading, enabling the model to focus solely on the intrinsic value of the option itself.

They assume investors are risk-neutral and value all future cash flows at the risk-free rate. Risk-neutral probabilities allow for the creation of a risk-neutral world, where options are priced in a way that eliminates riskless arbitrage opportunities. By incorporating risk-neutral probabilities, option pricing models determine option prices that align with market prices, assuming market efficiency.

    "In the binomial model, delta represents the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the price of the underlying asset.\n",
    "At each node of the binomial tree, the delta value can be calculated by comparing the option prices at that node with the option prices at the subsequent nodes.\n",

    "**Hedging Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the delta values are determined, they can be used to construct a hedging strategy to reduce or eliminate the risk associated with the option position.\n",
    "For a long call option position, the delta is positive, indicating a positive correlation with the underlying asset. To hedge against price decreases, a trader can sell (short) a certain number of shares of the underlying asset, determined by the delta value, to create a delta-neutral position.\n",
    "Similarly, for a long put option position, the delta is negative, implying a negative correlation with the underlying asset. To hedge against price increases, a trader can buy a certain number of shares of the underlying asset to maintain a delta-neutral position.\n",
    "By constructing a delta-neutral position, changes in the value of the option can be offset or minimized by changes in the value of the hedging instrument (shares of the underlying asset).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjustments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the price of the underlying asset changes, the delta value of the option will also change, requiring periodic adjustments to maintain a delta-neutral position.\n",
    "These adjustments involve buying or selling additional shares of the underlying asset to rebalance the position and keep the overall delta close to zero.\n",
    "The frequency of adjustments will depend on the desired level of delta neutrality and the specific hedging strategy employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk and Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While delta-neutral hedging using the binomial model can be effective in reducing directional risk, it does not eliminate other risks, such as volatility risk or changes in other option pricing factors.\n",
    "Additionally, the accuracy of the hedging strategy depends on the assumptions and inputs used in the binomial model, including the number of time steps and the estimation of up and down factors.\n",
    "Traders should monitor the effectiveness of the hedge and make adjustments as needed to adapt to changing market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the binomial model can be used to determine delta values, which serve as the basis for constructing delta-neutral hedging strategies. By maintaining a delta-neutral position, traders can reduce or eliminate the risk associated with the option's directional exposure. However, it is important to monitor and adjust the hedge as needed to account for changes in the underlying asset price and other market factors."

    "\n",
    "**Dividend adjustment** \n",
    "\n",
    "Dividends are periodic payments made by a company to its shareholders. When valuing options on stocks that pay dividends, it is important to adjust the stock price in the binomial model to account for the expected dividend payments. One approach is to subtract the present value of the expected dividends from the stock price in the up and down states. This adjustment ensures that the model accurately reflects the impact of dividends on the underlying stock's price movement.\n",

In the binomial model, interest rates are typically incorporated by discounting future cash flows back to the present value. The risk-free interest rate is used to determine the discount factor applied at each time step. Higher interest rates generally decrease the present value of future cash flows and can result in lower option prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Volatility adjustment** \n",

    "Volatility is a measure of the price fluctuations of the underlying asset. In the binomial model, volatility is usually assumed to be constant over the life of the option. However, in reality, volatility can change over time. One approach to incorporate time-varying volatility is to adjust the probability parameters in the binomial tree model to reflect changes in volatility at each time step. This adjustment allows the model to capture the impact of changing volatility on the option's price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implied volatility calibration** \n",
    "\n",
    "Implied volatility is the volatility parameter that, when plugged into an option pricing model, produces a theoretical price that matches the market price of the option. Traders and analysts often use implied volatility as a measure of market expectations for future volatility. When using the binomial model, the implied volatility can be calibrated by solving for the volatility parameter that produces the closest match between the model's calculated option prices and the observed market prices. This adjustment helps align the model with the market's implied volatility expectations.\n",
    "\n",
