    "There are several main reasons for the need for models that calculate the option pricing model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Valuation of options:** Options are financial derivatives whose value depends on the price movements of an underlying asset. Option pricing models enable market participants to determine the fair value of options, allowing them to make informed investment decisions. These models take into account factors such as the current price of the underlying asset, the strike price, time to expiration, volatility, and interest rates to calculate the option's value.\n",

    "These are the basic models for the option pricing model:\n",
    "\n",
    "   <img src=\"img/option_pricing_models.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk management:** Option pricing models play a crucial role in managing risk for individuals and financial institutions. By accurately valuing options, traders and investors can assess the potential risks associated with their portfolios. This information helps them hedge their positions or adjust their strategies accordingly, minimizing potential losses and maximizing returns.\n",

    "\n",
    "   <img src=\"img/risk_management.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market efficiency:** Option pricing models contribute to the efficiency of financial markets. When options are accurately priced, it reduces the likelihood of mispriced assets and arbitrage opportunities. This encourages fair pricing and promotes a more transparent and efficient marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Derivative pricing and trading:** Options are a type of derivative, which means their value is derived from an underlying asset. Option pricing models provide a foundation for pricing and trading other derivative instruments, such as futures, swaps, and forward contracts. These models help market participants assess the value of these instruments and make informed trading decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Academic research and financial analysis:** Option pricing models serve as a basis for academic research in finance and play a significant role in financial analysis. These models provide insights into market behavior, option pricing anomalies, and the relationship between various market factors. They form the basis for developing and testing trading strategies and evaluating the impact of different variables on option prices."

    "##### What Is Binomial Option Pricing Model?\n",
    "The binomial option pricing model is employed to calculate the value of an option using an iterative binomial framework. It is based on the presumption that the underlying assetâ€™s value follows a path of evolution. Hence it either increases or decreases by a fixed percentage during each period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial pricing model was first proposed by mathematicians Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein in 1979. The model provides a simple way to portray stock price movements and the interest rate term structure. The binomial model displays the underlying stock price movements using a discrete-time binomial lattice (tree) framework. One can identify it just by the probability of an upward rise and the size of the moves in the upward and downward phases of the options.\n",
    "\n",
    "An option is a significant financial derivative that provides the holder with the right to trade a defined quantity of the underlying asset at an agreed amount on the maturity date for a ***European option*** or at any time on or before the maturity date for an ***American option***.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=text-align:center><b>Binomial Tree Scheme</b></p>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/BOPM_scheme.jpg\" width=\"450\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial lattice option pricing model is a simple approach to calculating possible option prices. The model works on the key assumption that only two possible results exist for a particular stock. The two possible outcomes are a high and a low price. So the possibilities are also an assumption that the prices could go up or down. Therefore, investors need to assume the occurrence of the two stock prices at the end of the provided period. As always, one cannot predict this price with certainty, and it carries risks like all investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also works with the assumption of no arbitrage. i.e., there is no buying while selling at a higher price. No-arbitrage guarantees that the asset's value doesn't change. According to the no-arbitrage assumption, all risk-free investments generate a risk-free rate of return, and no investment possibilities demand zero money and generate positive returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practices ensure that the prices of financial assets, such as options, are fixed to a minimal tolerance from their theoretical values. One-period time model or one-period binomial option pricing model and multi-period binomial option pricing model or two-step binomial option pricing model are the types of binomial models used to determine option prices, and assumptions apply to them too."
